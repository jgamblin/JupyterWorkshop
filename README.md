# Jupyter Workshop BSidesLondon 2021

## Workshop

We will learn how to use [JupyterNotebooks](https://jupyter.org) to process and display data in this workshop. Throughout the whiteboard design session and hands-on lab, we will work through real-world examples of Jupyter Notebook uses for security professionals using open-source software and datasets. At the end of this workshop, you will have the basic skills needed to build jupyter notebooks.

## Introduction Session
